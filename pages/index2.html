                        <dd>If you plan the most comfortable option of visiting a sanctuary or zoo, make sure it is accredited and professionally managed.</dd>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <dt>SEE ANIMALS BEHAVE NATURALLY</dt>
                        <dd>Snake charmers and monkey circuses may be alluring, but what happens behind the scenes can horrify you. To avoid encouraging these practices, find a respected elephant sanctuary or take a jeep ride to admire the elephants in their natural habitat.</dd>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <dt>IT IS PROHIBITED TO CARRY</dt>
                        <dd>This instruction might disappoint you, but you have to understand the mistreatment that surrounds facilities that offer experiences of active participation or close contact with animals.</dd>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <dt>SPEND MONEY IN A SUSTAINABLE WAY</dt>
                        <dd>If you are really concerned about animal welfare and wildlife sustainability, consider hiring an expedition group rather than organizing each activity yourself.</dd>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <dt>RESPECT ANIMALS</dt>
                        <dd>It is dangerous for you and can also cause problems for the animal. Also, of course, never feed the animals.</dd>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <dt>ATTENTION WITH MEMORIES</dt>

                            <p> The top of the head, back and flanks, and tail have thick black protective hairs with beige tips on a softer undercoat, giving them a grayish-gray color. The rest of the body is black or almost black, except for a pale beige stripe running from forehead to shoulders along the lower margin of the gray hair area. The feet are webbed, with five toes ending in sharp, curved claws. </p>
                            <p> Females have a gestation period of 55 days and give birth between 1 and 10 young, which feed on mother's milk for approximately 10 weeks. </p>

                            <p> Like the llama, the guanaco is a camelid that is even rarer than the alpaca. It is covered by a thick, double coat that protects it. </p>
                            <p> Its height at the withers is 1 to 1.2 m and, if the head is included, between 1.8 to 1.9 m. Its weight is typically twice that of vicuÃ±as, around 100 kg, but it can reach up to 140 kg. Its fur is longer than that of the vicuÃ±a but shorter than that of the alpaca; It is also of excellent quality and reddish in color. </p>
                            <p> They have a dark head and whitish underparts and legs. They have large eyes with thick eyelashes to protect them from dust and dirt. Their ears are large and pointed. </p>

                            <p> Cougars are slender and agile cats. The adult standing size is around 70 to 90 cm in height at the shoulders. The length of adult males is around 2.7 m long from nose to tip of tail, males have an average weight of between 60 to 100 kg. The cougar can be as big as the jaguar, but less robust since the cougar is slender. </p>
                            <p> The coloration of the puma is uniform (hence the Latin name concolor), the coat is generally golden, but can be silver-gray or reddish in color, with slight patches on the body, including near the jaws, chin and the neck. Cougars have big legs; proportionally the largest hind legs in the feline family and strong and developed shoulders. </p>

                            <p> The coat is basically bicolor, presenting mostly a design with a black background color on which there are white stripes or bands, which suggests that, like other species with similar patterns, they warn their aggressors of the possession of some kind of hidden defense. They are omnivores, they can feed on insects, eggs, fruits, small mammals, birds, and honey. </p>

                            <p> Its behavior makes it habitually enter houses and it will almost always attack us between sunset and sunrise due to its nocturnal habits. </p>
                            <p> The larvae are aquatic like those of other mosquitoes, and they breed in all kinds of containers, channels, and structures with water, which means that we find them everywhere. In addition, we will find them both in clean and polluted waters. </p>
                            <p> In its larval stage it feeds on organic material and plants, while in the pupal stage they do not feed, preparing for the final phase of its cycle. When they reach maturity, females seek blood from animals (including humans) to reproduce, and males feed on pollen, fruit juice, and nectar. </p>

                            <p> The vinchuca presents different forms according to the growth stage in which it is, with a size that evolves from 2 mm to 2 cm or 3 cm in the adult state. It is brown in color, with a border of transverse bands that alternate in brown and light colors. The head is sharp with two slight protrusions that are the eyes; it has, like all insects, six legs and a pair of antennae. Its body is flat, but when it feeds its abdomen swells and its wings are raised, which are normally folded. </p>
                            <p> One of the characteristics of this insect is that it does not deposit the parasite in human tissue, but rather that, when it bites a person and sucks the blood, generally from areas close to the mouth such as the lips, their intestine swells and It forces it to defecate, depositing parasites on its victim's skin. Because of the itching, people scratch, and it is they themselves that incorporate the parasite into their tissues through this action. </p>

                            <p> It is native to stagnant or slow water bodies in temperate regions. It is a ubiquitous animal, easy to grow and has the characteristic of being ectothermal and eurythermal. It is a very resistant animal, capable of living in brackish waters with a temperature between 17 and 24 Â° C. </p>
                            <p> The common carp can measure 1.2 m in length and weigh up to 40 kg, although normally, in the adult state, it measures 60 to 90 cm, and its weight is around 9 kg. Nothing forming schools; it is omnivorous, and resistant to a wide variety of climatic conditions. There have been cases of specimens that have lived to 65 years. </p>

                            <p> Like other species of the genus Jenynsia, it is characterized by presenting a tubular gonopodium formed by the 3rd, 6th and 7th anal rays - which is associated with a spermatic duct - and for having the adult specimens tricuspid occlusion teeth in the mandible . The body color is light greenish-gray; on the sides it shows 6 to 8 dark thin lines, or dotted longitudinal stripes. The fins are colorless. Both sexes have the same coloration. The unfertilized female has an orange spot to the right or left of the anal fin. The male is considerably thinner and smaller than the female, who measures 6.6 cm. </p>
                            <p> Of all the species of the genus Jenynsia, J. lineata is the one with the largest distribution, widely covering the east-central and south-central South America. It inhabits both fresh and brackish water biotopes from temperate-cold to temperate-warm climates. On some occasions, this fish has been found living in seawater, along the coastline and in tide pools between the rocks. </p>

Silver coloration and somewhat bluish iridescence and a bright stripe on the flank. The tail is shaped like a fork. It lives mostly in schools. </p>
                            <p> Fast growing, it is one of the largest in adulthood; some specimens have reached 60 cm. long and 20 cm thick, and 3 kg in weight, however, the average size is smaller, 40 cm at 800 grams. Its high reproduction rate and the quality of its meat position it as an important species for intensive and extensive crops. </p>

                            <p> The maximum length recorded was a specimen of 120 cm, although the normal length is 60 cm. It has three to four spines on the dorsal fin. Breeding males do not show changes in the morphology of the head or the rest of the body as striking as those of other species of the same genus; the coloration of the skin varies greatly with the habitat and size; those that reside in rivers permanently are darker, similar to anadromous in reproductive age, while those that reside in lakes are lighter in color. </p>
                            <p> It is a fish from subtropical to cold waters and anadromous, that lives in the sea near the bottom in a depth range between 0 and 200 m, going up rivers to spawn. </p>
